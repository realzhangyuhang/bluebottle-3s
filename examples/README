Examples
=====================
This directory contains several examples of typical flow and particle
configurations on several GPUs. Each examples are designed to run with four
GPUs, though this can be modified as needed. The examples are:

  1) cuboctohedron-collision
    Used to validate multi-particle collisions. Twelve particles are placed at
    the vertices of a cuboctohedron surrounding a central particle, to which
    they are attached with a virtual spring. The particles move towards the
    central particle, eventually undergoing a collision.

  2) lid-driven-cavity
    A typical lid-driven cavity with the addition of particles. The z-direction
    is periodic.

  3) pressure-driven-duct
    The flow is driven in the periodic x-direction by an applied pressure
    gradient. The y- and z- directions have no-slip Dirichlet boundary 
    conditions. The initial condition is quiescent.
    
  4) sedimentation
    Particles are seeded in the domain and allowed to settle to the bottom under
    the influence of gravity. This example illustrates the use of a "screen"
    boundary condition, which acts as a solid no-slip wall to the particles but
    is invisible to the fluid.

  5) shear
    The particles are placed in a channel with applied Dirichlet velocity
    boundary conditions on the north and south walls, causing a shear flow.
    The initial fluid velocity condition is set to the expected shear flow
    profile.

  6) channel
    The fluid is driven in the periodic x- direction by an applied pressure
    gradient. The y- direction has no-slip Dirichlet walls on the top and
    bottom, and the z-direction is periodic. The initial condition is set
    to the expected channel flow profile.
