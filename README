Introduction
============

Bluebottle is the many-GPU extension of Bluebottle, a GPU-centric finite-
difference imcompressible Navier-Stokes flow solver coupled with the Physalis 
method for fully resolving spherical particles dispersed throughout the flow.
It is a research code developed by Daniel Willen (daniel.willen@jhu.edu) under
the supervision of Dr. Adam Sierakowski (sierakowski@jhu.edu) and Prof. Andrea
Prosperetti at the Johns Hopkins University.

The original single-GPU code was developed by Adam Sierakowski under the 
supervision of Prof. Prosperetti and can be found at:
